0.  JPEG(Joint Photographic Expert Groups) - almost 16 million
	GIF(Graphics Interchange Format) - lossless pallette based - 8 bits per pixel - 256 colors
	PNG(Portable Network Graphics) - used in mac and better than GIF in terms of compression - almost same as JPEG i.e. 16 million
	BMP(Bitmap Image Format) - true representation of an image - 24 bit per pixel - 2^24 colors

1.	Among all of them GIF supports animation.
  
2.	Lossy compression - compressing the size of the image by compensation on its quality so that minute details gets degraded but the overall quality of
						the picture is not that affected and the size of the file is reduced to a great extent. Eg : JPEG.
	Lossless compression - compressing the size of the image without compromizing the quality is called lossless compression. However the levels of compression
							in the size of the image is not that much. Eg : GIF, PNG.
3.  GIF, PNG
4.  When a file is deleted from a FAT system then the file's directory entry is removed from the allocation table such that we cannot know in which clusters
    the file is stored in the memory even though the file is present in pieces in the memory.
5.  If you want to delete the file so that it is unrecoverable then one should remove the pieces of the file stored in the memory as well as delete it's
    entry from the FAT table.
